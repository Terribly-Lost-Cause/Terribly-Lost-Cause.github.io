## Hey there — I'm [Cavell].

I build things. Sometimes they even work.

Right now, this site is a quiet little space on the internet where I keep track of the things I’ve made, broken, and occasionally fixed again.  
If you're here, you're either curious, lost, or very committed to clicking through random links. Either way: welcome.

### 🛠️ Projects

Most recently, I built a **Recycling Bin-Bot** — a robot that sorts trash based on its material.  
It got me into a competition. I didn’t win, but the thing *did* sort metal cans and plastic bottles 90% of the time, so I’m calling that a personal victory.

Want more about that? [Check out the project.](about.qmd)

### 🧠 Stuff I Like

- Fixing problems with code (and creating new ones accidentally)
- Minimalist design
- Systems that do one job well
- Bots, automation, and weird tech ideas that might just work

### 🎯 What I’m Doing Now

Learning new tools. Unlearning bad habits. Occasionally sleeping.  
This site is a work-in-progress — like most good things.
