## Using GenAI for My Website & Assessment

For this project, I used **ChatGPT**, a Generative AI (GenAI) tool developed by OpenAI, to help plan, write, and refine the content of my personal Quarto website.

I chose ChatGPT because it’s capable of giving fast, contextual feedback — especially when working with Markdown, HTML, and casual writing tone. I’ve used it like a writing partner and a logic-checker rolled into one.

### 🔧 How GenAI Helped Me

Instead of staring at a blank page, I used ChatGPT to **generate draft content** for different parts of the site — including:

- My **homepage**, where I wanted a personality-driven introduction
- A write-up for my **robot project**, which I struggled to describe without sounding either too vague or too technical
- A page about **Arknights**, a game I play, where I wanted to strike the right tone between personal and informative

The tool also helped with:
- Markdown formatting for tables, images, and links
- Writing in a consistent voice
- Rewording awkward phrasing while keeping my original intent

### ✅ Benefits I Noticed

- **Speed**: I could quickly test out multiple ways of saying something
- **Clarity**: GenAI helped me phrase things more clearly, especially when summarizing ideas
- **Tone control**: I was able to play with different voices — professional, casual, humorous — and pick one that matched me
- **Support without judgment**: It didn’t feel intimidating to experiment or admit I didn’t know how to start

### ❗Challenges I Encountered

- Sometimes the AI would be **too generic** or over-explain things I already knew
- It required **tweaking** — the first response was rarely the final version
- It couldn’t “see” my actual layout or files, so I had to mentally translate its suggestions into my working environment
- I still had to do the thinking — AI helped write, but **it didn’t decide for me**

---

### 🔮 Future Use of GenAI

I can see myself using GenAI tools in the future to:
- Draft reports, portfolios, and proposals
- Brainstorm project ideas or research questions
- Get quick feedback or suggestions when I hit a wall

That said, I view GenAI as a **starting point**, not a final answer. It’s a tool — a very helpful one — but the decisions and directions still need to come from me.
