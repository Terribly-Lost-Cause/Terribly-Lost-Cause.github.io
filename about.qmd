## My Project: The Recycling Bin-Bot ♻️

At some point, I built a robot that sorts trash.  
It’s not perfect, but it tried.

The **Recycling Bin-Bot** uses basic sensors and classification logic to detect the material of an object (plastic, metal, paper, etc.) and sort it into the correct bin. The idea was to make recycling a bit smarter — or at least slightly less chaotic.

I entered it into a competition.  
Didn’t win. Still kind of proud.

### What I Learned

- Basic robotics and sensor integration
- How to sort stuff (and my life, marginally)
- That failure in a competition isn’t really failure if you enjoyed the process (…mostly)

### Why It Mattered

Even though the bot wasn't flawless, it got people thinking about automation and sustainability. And I got to test my ability to build something practical(ish) from scratch.

> Would I do it again?  
> Probably. But with better wires.
